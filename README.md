## Based on research I conducted along with a team of Data Scientists and Web Developers about using neural networks to generate original images and audio, I'm attempting to build a neural network which can identify a molecule based on a Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope image of it.
## My goal after that will be to try to feed that output into a further model which will be able to identify key smell characterristics of larger quantities of that molecule. 
## If I can achieve that, then I will try to package everything into an application which can identify a substance using a user submitted image or description of smell.

### The nueral network will be trained on a dataset of 11350 training, 2431 validation and 3486 test TEM images, totalling 17267 images, or 16227 STEM images.  https://github.com/Jeffrey-Ede/datasets/wiki
